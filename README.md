# Ai-Assistant-Pro-v2

AI Assistant Pro is a powerful Streamlit application that lets users interact with state-of-the-art AI language models (such as Google Gemini and Groq LLMs) via a user-friendly web interface. The app supports:

Conversational AI chat (text or audio)

Speech synthesis (AI responds with voice)

Multimodal input: text, images, audio, video, PDF, DOCX files, and camera uploads

Choice of models (Google Gemini, Llama, Mixtral, etc.), including tools and summarization features

Automatic handling of file uploads and audio recording/transcription

Use cases include professional Q&A, document assistance, multimodal chat, academic search, and AI-generated summaries—all without exposing your API keys.

How it works in short:
Users interact through a web UI, select an AI model, chat via text or speech, upload media or documents, and get instant responses—including spoken, summarized, or enhanced answers—from cutting-edge AI models, securely.
